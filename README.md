## Datasets

### Human Locomotion Data

The data is pooled from the Edinburgh Locomotion, CMU Motion Capture, and HDM05 datasets.
Thanks for Gustav Eje Henter, Simon Alexanderson, and Jonas Beskow originally sharing the data [here](https://github.com/simonalexanderson/StyleGestures).
Please see the included README file for licenses and citations.

The preprocessed version of the human locomotion data is available at [here](https://kth.box.com/s/quh3rwwl2hedwo32cdg1kq7pff04fjdf). Download it to 'data/locomotion'.
